To date, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and overall well-being has become increasingly challenging.
Many individuals struggle to track habits that impact their mental and physical health, often relying on generic wellness applications that fail to account for personal priorities and routines.
While commercial well-being apps provide predefined tracking categories, they often lack flexibility and do not adapt to the unique needs of each user.

Well-MEing is a user-centered mobile application designed to help individuals efficiently track and improve their daily well-being.
Unlike existing commercial wellness apps, Well-MEing allows users to define and monitor the dimensions of well-being that matter most to them, such as skincare, sleep, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and meditation.

By offering customizable tracking and multimodal interaction, Well-MEing empowers users to build self-awareness and make informed decisions about their lifestyle, ultimately enhancing their overall well-being in a way that is both flexible and engaging.
