# Components

## Dashboard

The dashboard is where users can enter values for the habits they track and,
eventually, view their goals.

The dashboard is organized into cell-like sections, which are custom-made.
Each cell contains either an habit to track or a goal to reach.

Habit cells include input buttons that allow users to enter data using the
most suitable format, such as phaser, text input, grade, questionnaires...

## Progress

The progress section is where users can visualize their past data in a
structured and insightful way, displaying tracked habits over time.

Data is presented through graphs, summaries, and other visual condensations,
allowing users to identify improvements or inconsistencies.

## Assistant

The assistant section enables direct interaction with an LLM (e.g. via
speech-to-text) that suggests habits to track based on the user input.
It can also set personalized goals and adjust them over time.

Additionally, the LLM sends periodic messages (reports) with suggestions
and progress summaries.
This section acts as a smart guide, helping users optimize their habit tracking.

## Calendar

The calendar section lets users navigate past records by selecting any
specific day.
Clicking a date reveals the tracked data for that day, offering a clear
and accessible way to explore historical data.

## Profile

The profile section allows users to enter and update their personal information.
It also allows to add, edit, or remove tracked habits.
